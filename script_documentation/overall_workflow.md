Overall Workflow

1. Setup and Configuration
credentials.py: Contains configuration details for connecting to external services (e.g., Zendesk, Smartsheet) and script paths. This configuration is imported into main.py.

2. Script Execution Orchestration
main.py: Acts as the central orchestrator. It runs the scripts in a specified order, checks for the existence of required CSV files, and manages the creation and deletion of these files. The sequence of script execution is:
zendesk_data.py
smartsheet_to_csv.py
transform_sheet.py
update_smartsheet.py
update_tickets.py

3. Detailed Workflow
Step 1: Fetch Data from Zendesk

zendesk_data.py:
Connects to the Zendesk API and retrieves ticket data.
Saves the data to a CSV file (e.g., zendesk_tickets.csv).
Step 2: Pull and Transform Smartsheet Data
smartsheet_to_csv.py:
Connects to Smartsheet and pulls data.
Saves this data to a CSV file (e.g., smartsheet_data.csv).
Step 3: Transform Smartsheet Data
transform_sheet.py:
Reads the CSV file generated by smartsheet_to_csv.py.
Transforms the data as needed (e.g., normalizes formats, updates fields).
Saves the transformed data to a new CSV file (e.g., transformed_data.csv).
Step 4: Update Smartsheet
update_smartsheet.py:
Uses the transformed CSV data to update records in Smartsheet.
This step ensures that Smartsheet reflects the latest changes and data from Zendesk and other sources.
Step 5: Update Zendesk Tickets
update_tickets.py:
Reads the CSV file with ticket data (e.g., zendesk_tickets.csv).
For each ticket, constructs and adds comments based on the associated data.
Checks existing comments to avoid duplication and updates ticket status.

4. File Management and Error Handling
main.py:
Ensures that each script runs in the correct order.
Checks for the existence of required CSV files before proceeding.
Deletes the CSV files after successful execution of all scripts, following a 3-minute delay.
Handles retries if scripts fail or files are missing, ensuring robustness and reliability in execution.

5. Summary
Data Collection: zendesk_data.py and smartsheet_to_csv.py fetch and save data from Zendesk and Smartsheet respectively.
Data Transformation: transform_sheet.py processes and transforms the data.
Data Synchronization: update_smartsheet.py and update_tickets.py update Smartsheet and Zendesk based on the latest data.
Orchestration and Management: main.py manages the workflow, ensuring proper execution and file handling.

By following this workflow, the scripts collectively automate the data synchronization between Zendesk and Smartsheet, ensuring that both systems are up-to-date and reflect the latest information.
