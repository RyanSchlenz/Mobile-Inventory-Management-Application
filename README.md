# Mobile-Inventory-Management-Application

# Overview
The Mobile Inventory Management Application is a comprehensive solution designed to integrate and synchronize mobile inventory data between Zendesk and Smartsheet. This application consists of a series of scripts that dynamically pull, compare, update, and synchronize data to ensure accuracy and consistency across platforms. It handles large datasets efficiently and automates the process of inventory management.

# Project Structure
The application is comprised of the following scripts:

zendesk_data.py: Pulls data from Zendesk and saves it to a CSV file.
smartsheet_to_csv.py: Pulls data from Smartsheet and saves it to a CSV file if an IMEI on the Smartsheet matches an IMEI on the Zendesk CSV. 
transform_sheet.py: Normalizes all the IMEI data on the Smartsheet before uploading CSV data.
update_smartsheet.py: Uploads data from the Smartsheet CSV to Smartsheet, updating existing rows or adding new ones based on IMEI matches.
update_tickets.py: Updates Zendesk tickets with new comments if they donâ€™t already exist in the ticket history.
main.py: Runs all scripts in one file, and deletes the CSV files after successful completion of the script.

# Workflow

Fetch Data: Use zendesk_data.py to gather data from Zendesk and save to CSV files.
Compare and Update: Run smartsheet_to_csv.py to align the Smartsheet data with Zendesk data and save to a CSV.
Normalize Smartsheet Data: Run transform_sheet.py to correctly match existing IMEIs on the Smartsheet to the CSV data being uploaded. 
Upload Updated Data: Execute update_smartsheet.py to upload the updated Smartsheet data.
Synchronize Zendesk: Finally, run update_tickets.py to ensure Zendesk tickets are updated with the latest information.
Error Handling
